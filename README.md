![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/574a592e-5d60-49a9-810d-db44b4e235ff)

This project showcases a Production Analytics Dashboard developed using Microsoft SQL Server for data handling and Power BI for data visualization. The objective was to monitor, analyze, and improve the overall manufacturing performance through key metrics and insights.

üîß Tools Used
Microsoft SQL Server: For data extraction, transformation, and querying.

Power BI: For building interactive and dynamic dashboards.

üìà Dashboard Overview
The dashboard includes vital KPIs such as:

Total Production vs. Production Planned

Total Rejected Units

Total Working Hours, Uptime, and Downtime

Monthly Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)

Sub-metrics: Availability, Performance, and Quality

üîç Key Insights & Business Impact
Low Equipment Efficiency in Several Months

Insight: OEE was below the global target (85%) for most months, with the lowest in March (50%) and November (56.2%).

Impact: Persistent inefficiencies may indicate systemic issues in equipment or process management, impacting delivery timelines and cost-efficiency. Addressing this could lead to improved throughput and reduced operational costs.

High Product Quality

Insight: Quality remains extremely high at 99.3%, indicating robust quality control measures.

Impact: While high quality minimizes customer complaints and returns, the organization can now safely shift some focus toward improving availability and performance without compromising product standards.

Downtime Reduction Opportunity

Insight: A total of 8,321 hours of downtime was recorded.

Impact: Reducing downtime through predictive maintenance or process optimization could significantly improve availability (currently at 78.6%), directly boosting OEE and overall productivity.
