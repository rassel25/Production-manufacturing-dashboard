# 📊 Production Manufacturing Dashboard

![Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/574a592e-5d60-49a9-810d-db44b4e235ff)

This project showcases a **Production Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Microsoft SQL Server** for data processing and **Power BI** for interactive visualization. The goal is to provide real-time insights into manufacturing performance and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft SQL Server** – For data extraction, transformation, and storage.
- **Power BI** – For building dynamic, interactive dashboards.

## 📋 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key metrics:

- ✅ **Total Production**: 3,029,295 units  
- 📝 **Production Planned**: 3,795,496 units  
- ❌ **Total Rejected**: 20,708 units  
- ⏱️ **Total Hours**: 38,838  
- ⚙️ **Uptime**: 30,517 hours  
- 🔧 **Downtime**: 8,321 hours  
- 📊 **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** by Month  
- 📌 Sub-metrics: Availability, Performance, and Quality

## 🔍 Key Insights & Business Impact

### 1. ⚠️ OEE Consistently Below Global Benchmark
- **Observation:** The OEE is below the global target (85%) for 11 out of 12 months, with March and November showing the lowest values (50.0% and 56.2% respectively).
- **Impact:** Sustained inefficiencies lead to underutilization of resources and delayed deliveries. Targeting OEE improvements through root-cause analysis can lead to a measurable boost in productivity.

### 2. 🧪 High Product Quality
- **Observation:** Quality remains excellent at **99.3%**, surpassing industry norms.
- **Impact:** Minimizes costs associated with rework and returns, improving customer satisfaction. Focus can now shift toward improving equipment availability and speed.

### 3. ⏳ Excessive Downtime
- **Observation:** A total of **8,321 hours** of downtime recorded.
- **Impact:** Significant opportunity to increase operational efficiency by minimizing machine idle time through predictive maintenance and process streamlining.

### 4. 📉 Underperformance in March and July
- **Observation:** OEE dropped to **50.0% in March** and **59.0% in July**, well below acceptable thresholds.
- **Impact:** Highlights periods of potential equipment failure, labor issues, or supply chain disruptions. Investigating these anomalies can help prevent future performance dips.

### 5. 📆 May Achieved Peak Performance
- **Observation:** OEE reached **86.0% in May**, the only month above the global benchmark.
- **Impact:** Identifying and replicating the operational conditions or strategies used in May can help standardize best practices across other months and shifts.
