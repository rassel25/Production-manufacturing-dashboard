This project showcases a **Production Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Microsoft SQL Server** for data processing and **Power BI** for interactive visualization. The goal is to provide real-time insights into manufacturing performance and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft SQL Server** – For data extraction, transformation, and storage.
- **Power BI** – For building dynamic, interactive dashboards.

## 📋 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes the following key metrics:

- ✅ **Total Production**: 3,029,295 units  
- 📝 **Production Planned**: 3,795,496 units  
- ❌ **Total Rejected**: 20,708 units  
- ⏱️ **Total Hours**: 38,838  
- ⚙️ **Uptime**: 30,517 hours  
- 🔧 **Downtime**: 8,321 hours  
- 📊 **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** by Month  
- 📌 Sub-metrics: Availability, Performance, and Quality

## 🔍 Key Insights & Business Impact

### 1. ⚠️ OEE Below Global Target for Most Months
- **Observation:** OEE falls below the global benchmark of 85% in all months except May.
- **Impact:** Indicates inefficiencies in equipment or processes, potentially leading to production delays and increased costs. Targeted improvements can enhance overall operational efficiency.

### 2. 🧪 Exceptional Product Quality
- **Observation:** Quality metric is at **99.3%**.
- **Impact:** Demonstrates strong quality control, reducing rework and customer complaints. This allows focus to shift toward improving equipment availability and performance.

### 3. ⏳ Significant Downtime Logged
- **Observation:** Total of **8,321 hours** of downtime.
- **Impact:** Reducing downtime could increase equipment availability (currently 78.6%) and boost total production output, positively affecting OEE and revenue.
